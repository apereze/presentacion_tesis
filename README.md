This version of this template was made by Nikhil Alex V., BSMS '17.

The original IISER TVM thesis style has unknown origins and was modified into a template with inspiration from the efforts of other Indian Institutes.

This template has been modified to meet the IISER Thiruvananthapuram Thesis requirements.

Many man-hours will be required to improve this format to levels that match those of IISER Thiruvananthapuram's current contemporaries in academia. Those interested in assisting with the effort may contact [nikhil.alexv17@alumni.iisertvm.ac.in].
